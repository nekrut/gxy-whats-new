## Repository Summaries

### training-material
The Galaxy Project training material repository received updates to add external events, new organizations, and contributor information synced from the galaxy-hub. Several tutorials were enhanced with improved visualization steps and updated API key examples, while administrative tasks included updating cached commit data and persistent resource locators.

### galaxy-hub
The Galaxy Project's hub repository received updates to its website content and infrastructure this week. New content included the weekly newsletter for 2026-W05, several event pages for training courses and conferences, and highlighted talks for the upcoming GCC2026 conference. Technical improvements focused on fixing missing images in subdirectories, resolving URL routing issues in the Hall of Fame section, and synchronizing training material metadata from the Galaxy Training Network.

### tools-iuc
The Galaxy Project's tools-iuc repository added new tools including PIRATE and Mgnify genome search, while updating existing tools like fastp (to version 1.1.0) and vgp_processcuration (to version 1.1). The team also fixed issues with the mitobim form and resolved a problem with Medaka tools version 2.1.1+galaxy0 that was causing failures on Galaxy Australia and other instances.

### galaxy
This week, the Galaxy Project released version 26.0.rc1 and started development on version 26.1, while merging several bug fixes from version 25.1. Key changes include adding an agent-based AI tool recommendation feature, implementing admin controls to override memory settings, and fixing issues with workflow landing requests, user sharing components, and HTCondor job management. The team also addressed security concerns by preventing credential persistence during repository checkouts and fixing problems with invalid usernames in OIDC authentication systems.

### usegalaxy-tools
This week, the Galaxy Project's usegalaxy-tools repository received 12 merged pull requests focused on routine maintenance and tool updates. The changes included daily repository updates and installations of Intergalactic Workflow Commission (IWC) tools for usegalaxy.org, along with updates to specific tools including egapx, lexicmap wrapper, pysradb_search, and chainswap. Most activity involved automated maintenance tasks to keep the tool repositories synchronized across different Galaxy instances.

### brc-analytics
The Galaxy Project's brc-analytics repository released version 0.21.0 this week with several new features including LLM-powered natural language search functionality and a white papers section added to the homepage. Development work focused on improving the differential expression workflow with better quality control reporting, enhanced release processes that distinguish between development and production environments, and updates to the underlying findable-ui component library.

### usegalaxy-playbook
This week, the Galaxy Project's usegalaxy-playbook repository received two tool installation requests. Users requested the addition of gwtc_analysis for astronomy work and bcftools_plugin_split_vep to be installed on the ORG and AU Galaxy servers, as it is currently only available on the EU server.

### galaxy-k8s-boot
This week, the galaxy-k8s-boot repository had one merged pull request that added masthead images to the project. The change appears to be related to user interface elements, likely adding visual branding or header graphics to the Galaxy Kubernetes deployment system.

### galaxy-visualizations
This week, the Galaxy Project's visualization repository received four bug fixes and feature updates. The changes included restoring a default value that had been removed, fixing the plot height display issue in the LocusZoom visualization tool, and adding a materializer component to the Polaris visualization. Additionally, developers updated the chromosome input type in LocusZoom and upgraded it to a newer version.

### bioblend
This week, the Galaxy Project's bioblend repository merged one pull request that added a new method for extracting help text from tools. This change provides developers with programmatic access to tool documentation and usage information through the bioblend API.

### galaxy_codex
The Galaxy Project's galaxy_codex repository received updates to its imaging lab content and interactive tables, along with an automatic resources update and a dependency bump for ruby/setup-ruby from version 1.284.0 to 1.286.0. A new issue was opened to discuss promoting peer-reviewed content within the Labs section, specifically focusing on SPOC (presumably Single Point of Contact) implementation.

### galaxy-mcp
This week, the Galaxy Project's "galaxy-mcp" repository had one merged pull request that updated the schema version and bumped the package version to 1.3.0. This appears to be a routine version increment, likely preparing for a new release with updated specifications or compatibility requirements.

### iwc
This week, the Galaxy Project's "iwc" repository had one new issue created titled "Test release 26.0." No other activity details were provided for the repository during this period.

### gxy.io
This week, the Galaxy Project's "gxy.io" repository had one merged pull request that added a JXTX shortener for BoG. The change appears to be a minor addition to the URL shortening functionality of the service.

### planemo
This week, the Galaxy Project's "planemo" repository had minimal activity with only one new issue opened titled "Planemo improvements." No specific details about code changes, bug fixes, or feature additions are available from the provided information. The repository appears to have had a quiet week with limited development activity.

### galaxy-release-util
This week, one new issue was reported for the galaxy-release-util repository regarding a utility that appears to incorrectly assume invalid previous or next release versions. No other development activity, such as code commits or pull requests, was recorded for the repository during this period.
