## Repository Summaries

### tools-iuc
This week, the Galaxy Project's tools-iuc repository added new tools including PIRATE and Mgnify genome search, while updating existing tools like VGP processcuration (version 1.0 to 1.1) and fastp (version 1.0.1 to 1.1.0). The team also fixed issues with the mitobim form and resolved a problem with Medaka tools version 2.1.1+galaxy0 that was causing failures on Galaxy Australia and other instances.

### usegalaxy-tools
The usegalaxy-tools repository received regular updates throughout the week, with daily installations of Intergalactic Workflow Commission (IWC) tools for usegalaxy.org and routine repository updates. New tools were added including the latest version of the egapx tool, an updated lexicmap wrapper, pysradb_search, and chainswap for the main Galaxy instance.

### galaxy-hub
The Galaxy Hub repository received updates to fix missing images and other technical issues with the Astro framework, along with synchronization of files and metadata from the Galaxy Training Network. Several event pages were created or updated, including a new Galaxy Tools event at University Library Freiburg, a NUBRI kickoff event, and highlighted talks for the 2026 Galaxy Community Conference.

### usegalaxy-playbook
This week, the Galaxy Project's usegalaxy-playbook repository received two tool installation requests from users. One request was for the gwtc_analysis tool in the Astronomy category, and another was to install the bcftools_plugin_split_vep tool at ORG and AU servers, as it is currently only available on the EU server.

### training-material
The Galaxy Project training-material repository received updates to organizational information, including new organizations and contributors imported from galaxy-hub, plus grants and funding data for AusBioCommons and UniMelb. Tutorial content was enhanced with pre-visualization features and updated steps, while technical maintenance included updating cached commit data and persistent URLs. An external event for Love Data Week was also added to the repository.

### galaxy-k8s-boot
This week, the galaxy-k8s-boot repository had one merged pull request that added masthead images to the project. This appears to be a user interface enhancement that adds visual branding elements to the Galaxy Kubernetes deployment tool.

### galaxy
This week the Galaxy Project released version 26.0.rc1 and started development on version 26.1, while merging fixes from the 25.1 branch into the main development branch. Key changes included adding an AI-powered tool recommendation system, fixing workflow-related issues like duplicated sharing entries and landing request storage, and resolving problems with data manager file selection and HTCondor job handling. The team also addressed several user interface bugs, improved code typing and configuration, and updated dependencies including python-multipart and locuszoom packages.

### brc-analytics
The Galaxy Project's brc-analytics repository released version 0.21.0 this week, adding LLM-powered natural language search functionality and a white papers section to the homepage while removing the survey card component. Development work focused on improving workflow quality control reporting, enhancing release processes to handle different branch versions, and updating the underlying findable-ui framework to its latest version.

### galaxy-visualizations
This week, the Galaxy Project's visualization repository received four updates focusing on bug fixes and feature additions. The changes included restoring a default value, fixing plot height issues in the LocusZoom visualization tool, adding a materializer component to the Polaris visualization, and updating the chromosome input type in LocusZoom along with a version upgrade.

### bioblend
This week, the Galaxy Project's bioblend repository had one merged pull request that added a new method for extracting help text from tools. This addition expands the library's capabilities for programmatically accessing tool documentation within the Galaxy bioinformatics platform.

### iwc
This week, the Galaxy Project's "iwc" repository had one new issue created titled "Test release 26.0." No other specific changes or activities were provided in the summary.

### galaxy_codex
The Galaxy Codex repository received several updates this week, including improvements to the imaging lab, automatic resource updates, and interactive table functionality. The Ruby setup dependency was upgraded from version 1.284.0 to 1.286.0. A new discussion was started about promoting peer-reviewed content in Labs, specifically regarding SPOC (Single Point of Contact) implementation.

### galaxy-mcp
This week, the Galaxy Project's "galaxy-mcp" repository had one merged pull request that updated the schema version and bumped the package version to 1.3.0. This appears to be a routine version update, likely preparing for a new release of the software.

### galaxy-release-util
This week, one new issue was reported in the Galaxy Project's galaxy-release-util repository regarding the utility incorrectly assuming invalid previous or next release versions. No other code changes, pull requests, or repository activity occurred during this period.

### gxy.io
This week, the Galaxy Project's "gxy.io" repository had one merged pull request that added a JXTX shortener for BoG (Biology of Genomes). This appears to be a URL shortening functionality specific to JXTX-related content or events.

### planemo
This week, one new issue was opened in the planemo repository titled "Planemo improvements," though no specific details about the proposed improvements were provided in the issue title. No other development activity, such as code commits or pull requests, was reported for this period.
