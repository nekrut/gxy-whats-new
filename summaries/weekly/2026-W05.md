## Repository Summaries

### usegalaxy-tools
This week, the usegalaxy-tools repository received regular daily updates to install tools from the Intergalactic Workflow Commission (IWC) and sync all repository versions. New tools were added including pysradb_search and chainswap for the main Galaxy instance, while existing tools egapx and lexicmap wrapper were updated to their latest versions.

### tools-iuc
The Galaxy Project's tools-iuc repository added the PIRATE tool and Mgnify genome search functionality, while updating the fastp tool from version 1.0.1 to 1.1.0 and the vgp_processcuration tool from version 1.0 to 1.1. Contributors also fixed a form issue with the mitobim tool and resolved a problem with Medaka tools that were broken on Galaxy Australia and other Galaxy instances.

### galaxy-hub
This week's Galaxy Hub repository activity focused on fixing technical issues and updating event information. Multiple pull requests addressed missing images and other problems in the Astro framework, while several commits synchronized files and metadata with the Galaxy Training Network. The team also created and updated various event pages, including a new Galaxy Tools event at University Library Freiburg, a NUBRI kickoff event, and details for the 2026 Metagenome Training Course and GCC2026 conference.

### galaxy
The Galaxy Project repository merged 25 pull requests this week, including the release of version 26.0.rc1 and development version 26.1.dev, along with multiple bug fixes for the 25.1 branch. Key changes include adding an AI-based tool recommendation system, fixing various user interface issues like duplicated entries in sharing dialogs and workflow editor problems, and implementing security improvements such as not persisting credentials when checking out repositories. The team also addressed 13 existing issues while opening 16 new ones, focusing on areas like database migrations, workflow functionality, and user interface improvements.

### training-material
This week, the Galaxy Project training-material repository received updates to organizational and contributor information, including new organizations from galaxy-hub, grants updates, and contributor additions. Several tutorial improvements were made, including enhanced pre-visualization steps, updated API key examples, and persistent URL updates. The repository also added information for external events like Love Data Week and included a new bio for BIONT organization.

### usegalaxy-playbook
This week, the Galaxy Project's usegalaxy-playbook repository received two new tool installation requests. Users requested the addition of gwtc_analysis for astronomy workflows and bcftools_plugin_split_vep to be installed on the ORG and AU Galaxy servers, as it is currently only available on the EU server.

### galaxy_codex
The Galaxy Codex repository received four merged updates this week: an imaging lab update, automatic resource updates, a Ruby setup dependency bump from version 1.284.0 to 1.286.0, and interactive table improvements. A new issue was opened regarding the promotion of peer-reviewed content in Labs, specifically related to SPOC (Self-Paced Online Courses).

### galaxy-visualizations
This week, the Galaxy Project's visualization repository received four merged updates focused on bug fixes and feature additions. The changes included restoring a default value, fixing plot height issues in the LocusZoom visualization tool, adding a materializer component to the Polaris visualization, and updating the chromosome input type in LocusZoom along with a version upgrade.

### bioblend
This week, the Galaxy Project's bioblend repository had one merged pull request that added a new method for extracting help text from tools. This enhancement allows users to programmatically retrieve documentation and usage information from Galaxy tools through the bioblend API.

### brc-analytics
The Galaxy Project's brc-analytics repository released version 0.21.0 this week with several new features including LLM-powered natural language search functionality and a white papers section added to the homepage. Development work focused on improving differential expression analysis workflows, configuring separate backend URLs for development and production environments, and removing the survey card component from the interface.

### galaxy-mcp
The Galaxy Project's "galaxy-mcp" repository had minimal activity this week, with only one merged pull request. The team updated the schema version and released package version 1.3.0.

### galaxy-k8s-boot
This week, the Galaxy Project's "galaxy-k8s-boot" repository had one merged pull request that added masthead images to the project. This appears to be a visual enhancement to the user interface components of the Kubernetes deployment configuration for Galaxy.

### gxy.io
This week, the Galaxy Project's gxy.io repository had one merged pull request that added a JXTX shortener for BoG. The change appears to be related to URL shortening functionality, though the specific technical details of the implementation are not provided in the available information.

### planemo
One new issue was opened in the Galaxy Project's planemo repository this week titled "Planemo improvements." No specific details about the nature of these improvements were provided in the issue summary.

### iwc
This week, the Galaxy Project's "iwc" (Intergalactic Workflow Commission) repository had one new issue created regarding testing release 26.0. The repository appears to have had minimal activity with only this single issue opened for discussion or tracking purposes.

### galaxy-release-util
This week, one new issue was reported for the galaxy-release-util repository regarding the utility incorrectly assuming invalid previous or next release versions. No other code changes, pull requests, or releases were made during this period.
