## Repository Summaries

### training-material
This week, the Galaxy Project training-material repository received updates to event listings, organizational information, and contributor records, including the addition of Love Data Week as an external event and new organizations from the galaxy-hub. Several tutorials were enhanced with pre-visualization features and updated steps, while technical maintenance included updating cached commit data and persistent resource locators.

### usegalaxy-tools
The Galaxy Project's usegalaxy-tools repository received 12 merged pull requests this week, primarily consisting of routine repository updates and tool installations. New tools added include the latest versions of egapx and lexicmap wrapper, along with pysradb_search and chainswap being deployed to usegalaxy.org. Daily automated updates were applied to install IWC (Intergalactic Workflow Commission) tools across different Galaxy instances including the main usegalaxy.org site and cloud deployments.

### galaxy-hub
This week, the Galaxy Project's galaxy-hub repository received updates to its website infrastructure, including fixes for missing images in subdirectories and various smaller technical issues with the Astro framework. The team added several new event pages, including a Galaxy Tools workshop at University Library Freiburg and a NUBRI kickoff event, while updating details for the 2026 Metagenome Training Course and adding highlighted talks for GCC2026. Additionally, the repository synchronized with training material files and imported events from the Galaxy Training Network (GTN), along with publishing the weekly Galactic Weekly newsletter for 2026-W05.

### tools-iuc
The Galaxy Project's tools-iuc repository added the PIRATE tool and Mgnify genome search functionality, while updating the VGP process curation tool to version 1.1 and fastp to version 1.1.0. The team also fixed a form issue with the mitobim tool and resolved a problem with Medaka tools that were failing on Galaxy Australia and other Galaxy instances.

### brc-analytics
This week the Galaxy Project's brc-analytics repository added LLM-powered natural language search functionality and configured separate backend URLs for development and production environments. The team also updated the homepage by adding a white papers section and temporarily removing the survey card, while improving the release workflow to better handle different branch versions.

### galaxy
This week, the Galaxy Project released version 26.0.rc1 and began development on version 26.1.dev, while merging maintenance fixes from version 25.1. Key changes included adding an agent-based AI tool recommendation system, removing the "Discover Tools" button from the workflow editor, and fixing issues with workflow landing requests and user sharing components. The team also addressed security concerns by preventing credential persistence during repository checkouts, improved type annotations throughout the codebase, and resolved bugs related to HTCondor job management and data manager file selection.

### galaxy-k8s-boot
This week, the galaxy-k8s-boot repository had one merged pull request that added masthead images to the project. This appears to be a visual enhancement to the user interface components of the Galaxy Kubernetes deployment tool.

### usegalaxy-playbook
This week, the Galaxy Project's usegalaxy-playbook repository received two new tool installation requests. Users requested the addition of gwtc_analysis for astronomy work and bcftools_plugin_split_vep for the ORG and AU Galaxy instances, as this tool is currently only available on the EU instance.

### galaxy-visualizations
This week, the Galaxy Project's visualization repository received four updates focused on bug fixes and feature additions. The changes included restoring a default value, fixing plot height issues in the locuszoom visualization tool, adding a materializer component to the polaris visualization, and updating the chromosome input type in locuszoom while upgrading its version.

### bioblend
This week, the Galaxy Project's bioblend repository had one merged pull request that added a new method for extracting help text from tools. This change expands the library's functionality by allowing users to programmatically access tool documentation and usage information.

### galaxy_codex
This week, the Galaxy Codex repository received updates to the imaging lab content and interactive tables, along with an automated resources update and a Ruby dependency bump from version 1.284.0 to 1.286.0. A new issue was opened to discuss promoting peer-reviewed content within the Labs section, specifically focusing on SPOC (Single Point of Contact) implementation.

### galaxy-mcp
This week, the Galaxy Project's "galaxy-mcp" repository released version 1.3.0 with an updated schema version. The update involved a single merged pull request that incremented the package version number and modified the underlying schema structure.

### iwc
This week, one new issue was opened in the Galaxy Project's "iwc" repository regarding testing release 26.0. No other repository activity such as pull requests, commits, or issue resolutions were reported for this period.

### gxy.io
This week, the Galaxy Project's "gxy.io" repository had one merged pull request that added a JXTX shortener for BoG. The change appears to be a URL shortening feature, though the specific technical details of the implementation are not provided in the activity summary.

### planemo
This week, the Galaxy Project's "planemo" repository had minimal activity with only one new issue opened titled "Planemo improvements." No other specific changes, commits, or pull requests were mentioned in the provided activity summary.

### galaxy-release-util
This week, one new issue was reported for the galaxy-release-util repository regarding a utility that appears to assume invalid previous or next release versions. No other development activity, such as commits, pull requests, or releases, occurred during this period.
