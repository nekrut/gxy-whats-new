## Repository Summaries

### galaxy-hub
The Galaxy Project repository "galaxy-hub" received updates to fix multiple technical issues with the Astro framework, including missing images in subdirectories and URL routing problems. Several new event pages were created or updated, including events for Galaxy Tools at University Library Freiburg, a 2026 Metagenome Training Course, and a NUBRI kickoff meeting, while highlighted talks were added for GCC2026.

### tools-iuc
This week, the Galaxy Project's tools-iuc repository added three new tools (PIRATE, Mgnify genome search, and datavzrd was requested) and updated two existing tools (vgp_processcuration to version 1.1 and fastp to version 1.1.0). The team fixed a form issue with the mitobim tool and resolved a breaking issue with Medaka tools version 2.1.1+galaxy0 that was affecting Galaxy Australia and other instances.

### usegalaxy-tools
The usegalaxy-tools repository received regular daily updates throughout the week, including repository synchronizations and installations of tools from the Intergalactic Workflow Commission (IWC) for both the main usegalaxy.org platform and cloud infrastructure. Several specific tools were added or updated, including new versions of egapx and the lexicmap wrapper, plus the installation of pysradb_search and chainswap tools.

### training-material
The Galaxy Project training-material repository received updates to add new organizations and contributors from the galaxy-hub, including funding organizations AusBioCommons and UniMelb. Contributors also enhanced tutorials with pre-visualization features, updated API key examples, added an external Love Data Week event, and made various technical improvements including persistent URL updates and cached commit data refreshes.

### galaxy
The Galaxy Project released version 26.0 release candidate 1 this week and merged the 25.1 branch into development. Development work focused on bug fixes including resolving issues with workflow sharing dialogs, HTCondor job management, and data manager file selection, while also adding new features like agent-based AI tool recommendations and improved type annotations throughout the codebase.

### brc-analytics
The Galaxy Project's brc-analytics repository was updated to version 0.21.0 this week, with the addition of LLM-powered natural language search functionality and a new white papers section on the homepage. The team also configured separate backend URLs for development and production environments, improved the workflow quality control reports, and removed the survey card component from the interface.

### galaxy-k8s-boot
This week, the Galaxy Project's "galaxy-k8s-boot" repository had one merged pull request that added masthead images to the project. The change appears to be a visual enhancement to the user interface components of the Kubernetes-based Galaxy deployment system.

### galaxy-visualizations
This week, the Galaxy Project's visualization tools received several bug fixes and updates. The team fixed plot height issues in the LocusZoom visualization tool and added a materializer component to the Polaris visualization. Additionally, they restored a default value setting, changed the chromosome input type for LocusZoom, and upgraded it to a newer version.

### usegalaxy-playbook
This week, the Galaxy Project's usegalaxy-playbook repository received two new tool installation requests. Users requested the addition of gwtc_analysis for astronomy work and bcftools_plugin_split_vep to be installed on the ORG and AU Galaxy servers, as it is currently only available on the EU server.

### bioblend
This week, the Galaxy Project's bioblend repository had one merged pull request that added a new method for extracting help text from tools. This change expands the library's functionality by allowing users to programmatically access tool documentation and usage information.

### galaxy-mcp
The Galaxy Project released version 1.3.0 of the galaxy-mcp repository this week. The update included changes to the schema version and incremented the package version number to reflect the new release.

### galaxy_codex
This week, the Galaxy Project's "galaxy_codex" repository received updates to its imaging lab content and interactive tables, along with an automatic resources update and a Ruby dependency upgrade from version 1.284.0 to 1.286.0. A new issue was opened to discuss promoting peer-reviewed content in Labs, specifically focusing on SPOC (Self-Paced Online Courses).

### iwc
This week, the Galaxy Project's "iwc" repository had one new issue created titled "Test release 26.0." No other activity details were provided for the repository during this period.

### gxy.io
This week, the Galaxy Project's "gxy.io" repository had one merged pull request that added a JXTX shortener for BoG. The change appears to involve adding URL shortening functionality, though the specific technical details and scope of the implementation are not detailed in the available information.

### planemo
This week, one new issue was opened in the Galaxy Project's planemo repository titled "Planemo improvements," though no specific details about the proposed improvements were provided. No other development activity, such as code commits or pull requests, was reported for the repository during this period.

### galaxy-release-util
This week, one new issue was reported in the galaxy-release-util repository regarding a utility that appears to incorrectly assume previous or next release versions are invalid. No other development activity, such as code commits or pull requests, was recorded for the repository during this period.
