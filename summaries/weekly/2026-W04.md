## Repository Summaries

### training-material
The Galaxy Project training-material repository received several updates this week, including the addition of funding organization information to tutorials and the creation of a draft event page for GTA 2026. Other changes included deprecating a reports tutorial, updating cached commit data, and making technical improvements to imaging tag identification for galaxy_codex.

### usegalaxy-tools
The Galaxy Project's usegalaxy-tools repository received regular maintenance updates this week, with repository-wide updates performed on January 24th and 21st. Several specific tools were updated or installed, including updates to the multimodal_learner and FragPipe tools (FragPipe was updated twice), installation of the sambamba suite, and installation of IWC (Intergalactic Workflow Commission) tools for usegalaxy.org.

### galaxy-hub
The Galaxy Project hub underwent website improvements this week, including the addition of Astro View Transitions for faster client-side navigation, a new Hall of Fame feature, and improved mobile menu functionality. Content updates included documentation for Galaxy 25.1's new credentials system, a blog post about Dataverse integration, imported GTN events and news, and the addition of Schema.org annotations for better search engine visibility. Technical maintenance involved fixing various rendering issues, updating dependency versions including lodash, and migrating communication links from Gitter to Matrix.

### usegalaxy-playbook
This week, the Galaxy Project's usegalaxy-playbook repository received two updates. The team increased memory allocation for a UCSC tool running on the Vertebrate Genomes Project (VGP) infrastructure and updated the system's blocklist.

### tools-iuc
This week, the Galaxy Project's tools-iuc repository added several new tools including UCSC chainswap, metaMDBG suite, and UCSC mafGene, while updating existing tools like geopandas (1.1.1 to 1.1.2), Panaroo (1.5.2 to 1.6.0), and snipit (1.6 to 1.7). The repository also enhanced functionality by adding support for compressed fasta files in Purge Dups, adding PAF as an output option for one tool, and fixing output issues for PAGE and tesseract tools.

### infrastructure-playbook
This week, the Galaxy Project's infrastructure-playbook repository had one merged pull request that added a postfix alias for ga2 help. This appears to be a configuration change to set up email routing or forwarding for help-related communications on the ga2 system.

### galaxy-k8s-boot
This week, the galaxy-k8s-boot repository merged one pull request that added support for instance resume functionality. This feature allows Galaxy instances running on Kubernetes to be resumed after being paused or stopped.

### brc-analytics
The Galaxy Project's "brc-analytics" repository received updates focused on sample sheet processing and differential expression (DE) analysis workflows. New features include validation panels for sample sheet classification and upload steps, automatic continuation after successful file uploads in the DE stepper, and the ability to add additional pairs to primary contrasts. The team also added full-stack Docker build capability, integrated UCSC file checksums, and made improvements to the learn section.

### galaxy
This week's Galaxy Project activity included several bug fixes and feature additions. The team fixed issues with dataset collection visualizations, workflow auto-layout crashes, startup performance regression, and various user interface problems like loading spinner positioning and input path handling. They also added initial DICOM format support, new pangenomics datatypes (pg and hg), subworkflow invocation export functionality, and tools for converting sample sheets to list collections, while dropping Python 3.9 support and updating multiple dependencies including gravity to version 1.2.0.

### galaxy_codex
This week the Galaxy Codex repository received updates to fix a YouTube video player on the earth-system lab introduction page and implemented testing for all commands in bash scripts. The repository also received automated dependency updates for Ruby and resources, along with initial curation work.

### iwc
This week, the Galaxy Project's iwc repository added two new microbiome analysis workflows: one for analyzing metagenomic raw reads without assembly and another for cgMLST (core genome Multi-Locus Sequence Typing) of bacterial genomes. The repository also updated existing host contamination removal workflows for both long and short reads from version 0.2 to 0.3, while making website improvements including better mobile filtering, visual consistency updates, and dependency updates for security patches.

### ansible-galaxy
This week, the Galaxy Project's ansible-galaxy repository had one merged pull request that incorporated changes from client version 25.1. The update appears to be a routine integration of client-side modifications into the main codebase.

### planemo-ci-action
This week, one pull request was merged to the planemo-ci-action repository that updated the CVMFS (CernVM File System) repository location. The change modifies where the continuous integration system retrieves reference data or tools from the CVMFS distributed file system.

### KegAlign
This week, the KegAlign repository had two bug fixes merged. The diagonal partition script was updated to correct an example, and the command line interface for manually running the diagonal partitioning script was fixed.

### planemo
This week, the Galaxy Project's Planemo repository had one merged pull request that added documentation for three workflow-related commands: workflow_track, invocation_download, and invocation (the title appears to be cut off). The update focused on improving the documentation coverage for Planemo's workflow management functionality.

### ansible-cvmfs
This week, the Galaxy Project's ansible-cvmfs repository had one merged pull request that added support for telemetry functionality. This change enables the collection of usage and performance data within the CVMFS (CernVM File System) Ansible automation tools.

### gravity
This week, the Galaxy Project's "gravity" repository had one merged pull request that updated the `settings_to_sample()` function to work with a newer version of Pydantic, a Python data validation library. This change ensures compatibility with the updated dependency and maintains the function's ability to generate sample configurations.

### galaxy-release-util
This week, the Galaxy Project updated their release utility tool to automatically update the galaxy-client dependency version during point releases. They also added task instructions to guide release managers through their workflow processes.
