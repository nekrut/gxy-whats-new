## Repository Summaries

### training-material
This week, the Galaxy Project training-material repository received updates to add funding organizations (AusBioCommons and UniMelb) to tutorials and created a draft event page for GTA 2026. Additional changes included deprecating the reports tutorial, improving imaging tag identification for galaxy_codex, and updating the lodash dependency from version 4.17.21 to 4.17.23.

### usegalaxy-tools
This week, the Galaxy Project's usegalaxy-tools repository received eight merged updates focused on tool installations and version updates. The changes included installing the sambamba suite and IWC tools on the main usegalaxy.org server, updating the multimodal_learner and FragPipe tools (with FragPipe receiving two separate updates), and performing routine repository synchronization updates on January 18th, 21st, and 24th.

### galaxy-hub
The Galaxy Project's hub repository underwent a major website migration to Astro this week, with developers implementing client-side navigation, mobile menu fixes, and various styling improvements including table of contents sidebars and linkable headers. The team added new features like a Hall of Fame section, imported events and news from the Galaxy Training Network, updated documentation for Galaxy 25.1's credentials system, and migrated communication links from Gitter to Matrix. Several content updates were made including a new Dataverse blog post, 2024 NAR paper citation, and metadata improvements across news and event items.

### usegalaxy-playbook
This week, the usegalaxy-playbook repository had two changes merged. The team increased memory allocation for a UCSC tool on the Vertebrate Genomes Project (VGP) infrastructure and updated a blocklist configuration.

### tools-iuc
This week, the Galaxy Project's tools-iuc repository added several new tools including the metaMDBG suite, UCSC chainswap, and UCSC mafGene, while updating existing tools like Panaroo (to version 1.6.0), snipit (to version 1.7), geopandas (to version 1.1.2), and lexicmap. The repository also received enhancements to existing tools such as adding fasta.gz support for Purge Dups, new output options for tesseract and PAF format support, plus various bug fixes and deployment improvements for MaAsLin3.

### infrastructure-playbook
This week, the Galaxy Project's infrastructure-playbook repository had one merged pull request that added a postfix alias for ga2 help. This appears to be a small configuration change to set up email routing or forwarding for help-related communications on the ga2 system.

### brc-analytics
This week, the Galaxy Project's brc-analytics repository focused on improving the differential expression (DE) analysis workflow by adding validation panels to sample sheet steps, enabling automatic progression after successful file uploads, and allowing users to add additional pairs to contrast analysis. The team also completed a sample sheet demo, implemented full-stack Docker build capability, added UCSC file checksums, and enhanced the learn section with FAQ content.

### galaxy-k8s-boot
This week, the Galaxy Project's "galaxy-k8s-boot" repository merged one pull request that added support for instance resume functionality. This feature allows Galaxy instances running on Kubernetes to be resumed after being paused or stopped.

### galaxy_codex
This week, the Galaxy Codex repository received updates to fix a YouTube video player on the Galaxy earth-system lab intro page and implemented testing for bash script commands. The repository also received automated dependency updates for Ruby setup and resources, along with initial curation work and a new issue requesting workflow input/output files functionality.

### ansible-galaxy
This week, the ansible-galaxy repository merged changes to incorporate updates from client version 25.1. The update resolved an issue where client tasks were failing in release 25.1 due to a conflict with Node.js already being present in Galaxy's virtual environment.

### iwc
The Galaxy Project's "iwc" repository received updates to several microbiome analysis workflows, including a new metagenomic raw reads analysis workflow, a bacterial genome cgMLST workflow, and version 0.3 updates to both short-read and long-read host contamination removal workflows. The repository's website was improved with smoother transitions, mobile filtering capabilities, visual consistency updates, and dependency updates including security patches for devalue and diff packages.

### galaxy
This week's Galaxy Project activity focused on bug fixes and dependency updates, with 31 pull requests merged addressing various interface and functionality issues. Key fixes included resolving crashes in the Auto Layout feature with conditional steps, correcting slow startup performance regression, and fixing problems with dataset collection visualizations and credential editing. The project also dropped support for Python 3.9, added initial DICOM format support, introduced new pangenomics datatypes, and updated several dependencies including gravity 1.2.0.

### KegAlign
This week, the KegAlign repository had two merged pull requests that addressed issues with the diagonal partitioning script. The changes fixed an example in the script and corrected the command line instructions for manually running the diagonal partitioning functionality.

### planemo-ci-action
This week, the Galaxy Project's "planemo-ci-action" repository had one merged pull request that updated the CVMFS (CernVM File System) repository location. This change modified where the continuous integration system retrieves reference data and tools during automated testing workflows.

### planemo
This week, the planemo repository had one merged pull request that added documentation for three workflow-related commands: workflow_track, invocation_download, and invocation (the title appears to be cut off). The update focused on improving the project's documentation coverage for workflow management functionality.

### ansible-cvmfs
This week, the Galaxy Project's "ansible-cvmfs" repository merged one pull request that added support for telemetry functionality. This change enables the collection of usage and performance data within the CVMFS (CernVM File System) Ansible automation tools used by the Galaxy bioinformatics platform.

### gravity
This week, the Galaxy Project's "gravity" repository had one merged pull request that updated the `settings_to_sample()` function to work with a newer version of Pydantic, a Python data validation library. This change modernizes the codebase to be compatible with updated dependencies.

### galaxy-release-util
This week, the Galaxy Project's galaxy-release-util repository received two updates. The team updated the galaxy-client dependency version to ensure compatibility during point releases and added new documentation with task instructions for release managers. These changes improve the release process workflow and provide clearer guidance for those managing Galaxy software releases.

### idc
This week, two new requests were submitted to the Galaxy Project's "idc" repository. Users requested the addition of the mpa_vJan21_TOY_CHOCOPhlAnSGB_202103 MetaPhlan database and an update to Dada2 indexes that includes Silva databases.
